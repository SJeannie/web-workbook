    <h4> Life is a scavenger hunt for the blessings strewn around us. </h4>

    <p>
    Too often I hear people complain - of boredom, of unfairness, of all the
    depravities and lacks in their lives -
    <p>
    Yet, I wonder, but what about all the good things in your life?
    <p>
    I believe we were born to be happy.  I believe that our singular purpose in
    life is to be happy - and because we are happiest and strongest when we are
    in love, the purpose of our lives is to be better at loving others
    and at receiving love.
    <p>
    Seeing the blessings around us takes practice.  But practice also makes us
    better.
    <p>
    Happiness is so much more a process than an end result.  It's too much in
    motion to be stationary a state.
    <p>
    Here's to happiness.

    <h4> Decide what's next in your life and strategize how to get it. </h4>

    <p>
    While teaching seventh grade reading and writing, I realized that
    I was the bottleneck to my students receiving individualized feedback on
    their writing; it took me upwards of 16 hours to grade and comment on 108
    students’ essays. Because it wasn't sustainable for me to comment on all 7
    essays that I had assigned in 7 weeks, I taught my students to grade each
    other’s essays and give feedback.

    <p>
    That was more beneficial to my students than it was to me.  (Well, let's be
    real - that was beneficial to me, too.)  They developed a better writing
    acumen and, with practice, were able to critique fairly and accuratel -
    and the idea for WriteBack, a platform where students commune and give each
    other feedback, was born.

    <p>
    My subsequent path of bringing this idea to life involved leaving the
    classroom (aka becoming unemployed), finding a team that believed in the
    idea, and pushing myself to work my own schedule and stay committed, not
    only to working on the idea but to learn about every aspect of entrepreneurship.

    <p>
    Within the first six months, my team of three fell apart; the developer
    wanted to monetize immediately, and I wanted the service to be available for
    free; the whole idea, afterall, existed for the purpose of servicing my
    students and others like them, a majority of whom were non-native English
    speakers and had immigrant parents who couldn't help them with their English
    assignments.

    <p>Through that painful experience, I learned more concretely than ever that
    a team needs to share the mission and vision.  It sounds so obvious, and the
    team may even share the same mission, but it's not always clear what each
    other's vision is, or how each person aims to fulfill the mission.

    <p>
    I then worked with another set of developers that I hired out of pocket.
    Granted I met them while I was traveling in Morocco (which may have involved
    a meeting with the lead developer close to midnight in a car on a street
    corner and showing my mockup slides on a tablet...) and knew that their
    estimate of 3 weeks' turnaround was outright outrageous, I didn't realize
    the degree to which cultural differences may come to play a part in our
    interactions - or our ideas of time or work expectations.  And this, too,
    I should have known - I myself identify with an amalgam of different cultures.

    <p> Both of these experiences serve as a reminder that what we know in
    theory is rarely what's to be expected in practice - and perhaps that's the
    lesson I needed to learn, that things rarely go as planned and that that
    should be the baseline expectation.

    <p>
    And to have patience. And to stay persistent.

    <p>
    And perfectly in line with the lesson I've learned - I've digressed.  I was
    going to write about what I want and how I plan to go after it - but for
    now, I'll end with just the fact that no matter what, keep pushing to get
    what you want.  Only the end results tell how much you wanted something.
    If you want something, if you <b>really</b> want something, you'll make it happen.

    <p>

  <h4> Contentment vs. Drive </h4>

      I've borne this very perspective since I was a kid.
      I once shared it as an adult, and the person hearing
      it said that makes me an existentialist. He also seemed
      unconvinced - and I think that was the fear locking
      him in.</p>

      <p> The very idea of looking at the empty part of
      glass and seeing what one can do to change it  -
      and actually doing something about it once the
      assessment sets in - requires awareness, then action,
      and even envisioning change and the work required to
      make it happen is often scary. Recognizing that can
      also lead to self-criticism - "You know what you need
      to do, so why aren't you doing it," "are you so
      cowardly that you won't even try," "why can't you get
      your act together?" - so people then often shove it
      under the rug and choose the status quo. In case you
      can't tell, this comes from firsthand experience, and
      these are things I say to myself all the time. </p>

      <p> Continuing to challenge ourselves in and of
      itself is a challenge. Letting inertia play out is
      so much easier, yet inertia is both a friend and foe
      in finding the balance between acceptance/contentment
      and self-improvement. </p>

    <p>Fight on. Only dead fish go with the flow. </p>
