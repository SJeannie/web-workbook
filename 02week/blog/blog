      <p>
      I've borne this very perspective since I was a kid.
      I once shared it as an adult, and the person hearing
      it said that makes me an existentialist. He also seemed
      unconvinced - and I think that was the fear locking
      him in.</p>

      <p> The very idea of looking at the empty part of
      glass and seeing what one can do to change it  -
      and actually doing something about it once the
      assessment sets in - requires awareness, then action,
      and even envisioning change and the work required to
      make it happen is often scary. Recognizing that can
      also lead to self-criticism - "You know what you need
      to do, so why aren't you doing it," "are you so
      cowardly that you won't even try," "why can't you get
      your act together?" - so people then often shove it
      under the rug and choose the status quo. In case you
      can't tell, this comes from firsthand experience, and
      these are things I say to myself all the time. </p>

      <p> Continuing to challenge ourselves in and of
      itself is a challenge. Letting inertia play out is
      so much easier, yet inertia is both a friend and foe
      in finding the balance between acceptance/contentment
      and self-improvement. </p>

    <p>Fight on. Only dead fish go with the flow. </p>
